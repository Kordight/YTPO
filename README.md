# What is YouTube Playlist Organizer?

YTPO is a program written with the help of the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library. This script can list similar video titles, and invalid video links, and save a report in `.txt`, `.csv`, and user-friendly `.html` formats detailing what videos are in a playlist. YouTube Playlist Organizer can also download videos from a playlist and save them as mp3 or mp4 files.
YTPO also can save your playlist report to MySQL database.

## Setup

Download the `.zip` from GitHub or type:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/Kordight/YTPO
```

Then enter the project directory. In order to make it work, you need [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) . You can install them by typing in terminal/cmd:

```sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This script requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

Then you need to edit `config.ini`.

- `min_similarity=` determines the minimum similarity of titles to catch, default `0.75`, valid values: from `0` to `1`.

- `download_video=` enables or disables downloading videos from the playlist, default `0`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `download_music=` enables or disables downloading audio from the playlist, default `0`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `backup_playlist=` enables or disables saving all links and titles to a `.txt` file, default `0`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `download_wav=` enables or disables saving audio from the playlist as `.wav` files, default `0`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `use_csv_file=` enables or disables saving reports from the playlist as `.csv` and `.html` files, default `1`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `resume_playlist_download=` enables or disables resuming download on lates finished video from playlist, default `1`, valid values: `0` or `1`.

- `use_database=` enables or disables saving report to the MySQL database, default `0`, valid values: `0` or `1`.
  
 Tip: You can enable multiple ways to save your playlist simultaneously.

## Running the Program

You can run the program by opening CMD or Terminal and typing this command:

```sh

python3 main.py
```

Alternatively, you can run this command:

```sh

python main.py --playlistURL "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL"
```

Without an argument, the program will ask for a playlist link. A valid link looks like this: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoflVrROeM3MLY-78dZTsWnkZWextssm`. Then you have to wait for the program to finish its job. `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.html` reports can be found inside the `Output/{Playlist_name}` folder, audio files inside the `Output/{Playlist_name}/Music` folder, and `.mp4` files inside the `Output/{Playlist_name}/Videos` folder. These folders are available in the program directory.
