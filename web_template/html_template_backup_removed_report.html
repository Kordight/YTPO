        <p>This report was generated automatically using the playlist backup functionality. Unfortunately, your playlist
            contains videos that are no longer available on the YouTube platform. Luckily, you can still learn their
            titles (mostly...). Here are a few steps on how to do it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the link of the unavailable video and search for it in previous YTPO reports (CSS, HTML, SQL).</li>
            <li>Click on the automatically generated link next to the unavailable title to search for it on the Internet
                Archive.</li>
            <li>Search for the link online. On some other pages, you might find the context and guess the title.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm continuously working to further improve this tool.</p>
