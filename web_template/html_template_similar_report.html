        <h2>Thank you for using <a href="https://github.com/seba0456/YouTube-Playlist-Downloader-And-Organizer">YTPO</a>!</h2>
        <p>This report was generated automatically using a CSV file. It includes all videos with similar titles. This
            report can be very useful if you need to identify and manage duplicate videos in your playlists.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer!</b> This tool only compares similarity in video titles. It may generate inaccurate results and
            does not compare actual video content. Videos with completely different titles will not be listed as
            duplicates. You can adjust the similarity tolerance in <i>config.ini</i>, located in the program's root
            directory.</p>
        <p>I'm continually working to enhance this tool.</p>
